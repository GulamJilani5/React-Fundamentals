What's New in Express.js 5.0? üöÄ

Express.js has just released version 5.0, the first major update since 2014. Here‚Äôs a quick look at the key changes and what you need to know:

1. Node.js 18 Required
   To use Express.js 5.0, you must upgrade to Node.js 18 or higher.

2. How to Install
   To try it out, use this command:
   npm install --save express@next

3. Removed Methods
   Several old methods have been removed, including:

- app.del() ‚û°Ô∏è Use app.delete() now.
- app.param(fn) has been removed, so it's time to refactor if you're using it.

4. Route Matching Updates
   Express 5 changes how routes are matched. For example, if you used /user*, now update it to /user(.*).

5. Simplified Error Handling
   No need to manually handle promise rejections in async functions! Express.js 5 automatically passes errors to the error handler.

6. Dropped Support for Older Node.js Versions
   If you're using Node.js 14 or older, it's time to upgrade. Express.js 5 only supports Node.js 18 and up.

7. Other Key Improvements

- Stricter Error Handling: Now you‚Äôll get an error if you use invalid status codes (e.g., res.status(999)).
- Security Enhancements: The Express.js team added security tools to catch vulnerabilities.
- Refactored Dependencies: Fewer external packages, which means faster and more secure apps.
